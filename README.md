# 🏎️ Formula 1 Race Winner Analysis Dashboard

## 📖 Overview
This project is an interactive **Streamlit project that analyzes **Formula 1 race data** to explore the factors that determine a race winner.  
It uses **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, and a **machine learning model** to predict and visualize race outcomes.

The dashboard allows users to:
- View detailed statistics per track (e.g., Italian Grand Prix)
- Understand key factors influencing race results
- Explore visualizations like:
  - Feature importance charts
  - Grid position vs. team performance scatter plots
  - 3D winner distribution analysis
  - Violin plots comparing winners vs non-winners
